    This project is a web application for creating and managing tournaments for the game <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Users can create their own tournaments and upload data as a CSV file collected from games played by tournament participants. They can add all the data from a tournament at once, if entering it after it is completed, or update the tournament data across multiple uploads as the tournament progresses in real time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tournament owner can set the tournament as either public or private. Public tournaments are accessible to all site visitors, while private tournaments are only accessible to people invited by the owner. Users can search for public tournaments and see a list of all tournaments they created or that have been shared with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on the uploaded data, we then provide uses with a variety of ways to view their team or individual performances in the tournament, with numerous metrics and visualisations to bring the make the data easy to understand and to be able to find useful insights quickly. To make it easier for users to upload data, we have a guide page which explains the format of the CSVs and allows them to download templates and examples.
