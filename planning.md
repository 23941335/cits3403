# Database Format

**Note:** this is representative of the concepts and fields we store in the database, not necessarily the underlying logical structure. This is a higher abstraction, but the tables will be more normalised in the actual database.

_The database structure will be quite normalised (so there will be more tables than maybe is strictly necessary), but I think I will write some de-normalised views to make it easier for others to interact with it for read access, which will be most common for retrieving and displaying it to the front end._

- Team players (need to record this unless we assume the same team always has same players which is not realistic, and is needed for good player-level stats recording)
